# Chatify 💬

A real-time chat application with individual and group messaging features.

## Project Description ✨

This project is a practice application that I built to dive into real-time communication and web development. It started as a personal chat application based on a helpful YouTube tutorial, and I've expanded it to include full-fledged group chat functionality. I also transitioned from Zustand to Redux for state management, big thanks to Hitesh Chaudhary and Harkirat Singh for their valuable content!

## Features 👍

*   **One-on-One Chat:** Connect and send direct messages to other users instantly. 🤝
*   **Group Chat:** Create groups, invite friends, and chat together in a shared space. 👥
*   **Real-time Updates:** Messages and user status updates appear in real-time, thanks to the magic of Socket.IO. ✨
